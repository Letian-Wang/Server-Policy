# Server-Protocol
To make effective use of the server and avoid usage conflict, you


1. To avoid usage conflit, when you plan to use the server, you'll need to schedule and check the Server_Availability_Sheet:

            1. Sign your name and highlight the intensity of resource comsuption.
            
                TODO: SHEET
                
                Green means you're doing some light jobs that do not compete on the resources with other users. 
                
                Red means the load is intense and do not recommend simultaneous usage. 
                
            2. If there is already someone else occupying the time slot:
            
                When the slot is green, you can append your name in the sheet and do some light jobs on the server. But high-intensity work is not recomended. 
                
                When the slot is red, you're not recommended to use the server at the same time. you can schedule a late time or coordinate with the current user if you're in hurry.
                
        2. The command to ssh into the server:
        
            ssh {user_account}@host_ip_address -p{port_num}
            
           If you cannont log in, it is highly possible that the port_num is changed. Check the update in the "server" channel on slack
